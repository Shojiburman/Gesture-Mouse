# Gesture-Mouse
The evolution of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has diverted the interest of researchers towards natural interaction techniques in recent years. The apparition on the market of the low-cost gyroscope with, at least, satisfactory qualities open up new directions regarding the implementation of HCI interfaces. The project presents an HCI interface for mouse cursor control and the purpose of the implemented solution is to control the mouse cursor by using hand gestures captured through a gyroscope.
